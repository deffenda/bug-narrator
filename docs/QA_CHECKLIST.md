## Core Workflow

- Start a feedback session from the menu bar.
- Verify the status changes to `Recording`.
- Verify the red recording indicator and elapsed timer appear and continue updating.
- Switch between apps, click around, and keep speaking for at least 15 seconds.
- Insert at least two markers during the session.
- Capture at least one screenshot during the session.
- Stop the session.
- Verify the status changes to `Transcribing` and then `Success`.
- Verify the session library window opens with the completed transcript selected.
- Verify the transcript is copied to the clipboard when auto-copy is enabled.
- Verify the new session appears in the session library immediately after the run.

## Session Library Browsing

- Verify the left sidebar shows `Today`, `Yesterday`, `Last 7 Days`, `Last 30 Days`, `All Sessions`, and `Custom Date Range`.
- Verify each sidebar filter shows a session count that changes as sessions are added or removed.
- Switch between `Today`, `Yesterday`, `Last 7 Days`, `Last 30 Days`, and `All Sessions` and confirm the session list updates without UI lag.
- Set a custom start date and end date and confirm only sessions in that range are listed.
- Enter a search term that matches transcript text and verify the list narrows to matching sessions.
- Enter a search term that matches extracted issue summary text and verify the list narrows to matching sessions.
- Change sorting to `Oldest First` and confirm the list order reverses correctly.
- Select a session from the list and verify the detail pane updates in place without opening a separate popup.
- Verify the detail pane keeps access to raw transcript, markers, screenshots, extracted issues, and export actions.
- Verify an empty state appears for no sessions yet, no sessions in a filter, no sessions in a custom date range, and no search results.

## Marker And Screenshot Workflow

- Insert a marker during recording and verify it appears in the `Markers` tab with the correct time.
- Capture a screenshot during recording and verify it appears in the `Screenshots` tab.
- If the screenshot is near a marker, verify the screenshot shows a linked marker when practical.
- Open a captured screenshot from the review window and verify Finder reveals the file.
- Export a session bundle and verify `transcript.txt`, `transcript.md`, `summary.md`, and the `screenshots` folder are present.

## Session Deletion

- Select a saved session and delete it from the library toolbar.
- Verify a confirmation dialog appears before permanent deletion.
- Confirm the deleted session disappears from the list immediately after confirmation.
- Verify sidebar counts update after deletion.
- Verify the detail pane switches to the next available session or an empty state.
- Delete a session from the row context menu and verify the same behavior.
- Delete a session that contains screenshots and verify the app warns that local screenshots will also be removed.
- Verify exported files outside BugNarrator remain untouched after deleting the session.

## Issue Extraction Workflow

- Open a completed session and run `Extract Issues`.
- Verify the `Extracted Issues` tab shows a summary, guidance note, and categorized draft issues.
- Verify each issue preserves transcript evidence and timestamp context when available.
- Edit an extracted issue title, summary, or category and confirm the change persists when you switch away and back.
- Select and deselect issues for export and verify the selection state persists.
- Enable automatic issue extraction in Settings and confirm a later session runs extraction automatically after transcription.

## GitHub Export

- Configure a GitHub token, repository owner, and repository name in Settings.
- Verify GitHub export buttons stay disabled until configuration is complete.
- Export one selected issue to GitHub and confirm a new issue appears in the target repository.
- Export multiple selected issues and confirm each selected issue becomes a separate GitHub issue.
- Verify the GitHub issue body contains transcript evidence and timestamp references.
- Use a bad token or repository name and verify BugNarrator shows a clear export error.
- Force one issue export to succeed and a later one to fail, then verify BugNarrator reports partial success instead of a generic failure.

## Jira Export

- Configure Jira Cloud URL, email, API token, project key, and issue type in Settings.
- Verify Jira export buttons stay disabled until configuration is complete.
- Export one selected issue to Jira and confirm a new issue appears in the configured project.
- Export multiple selected issues and confirm each selected issue becomes a separate Jira issue.
- Verify the Jira issue description contains transcript evidence and timestamp references.
- Use a bad token, bad project key, or invalid issue type and verify BugNarrator shows a clear export error.
- Force one issue export to succeed and a later one to fail, then verify BugNarrator reports partial success instead of a generic failure.

## Repeated Session Regression

- Complete a full start-record-stop-transcribe cycle with markers and screenshots.
- Start a second session without restarting the app.
- Complete a second full cycle and verify the new session appears first in the session library when sorted newest-first.
- Repeat once more with automatic issue extraction enabled.
- Verify the app never gets stuck in `Recording`, `Transcribing`, or export-in-progress state.

## Failure Cases

- Remove the OpenAI API key and attempt to start a session.
  Expected: a clear missing-key error is shown and Settings opens.
- Start recording, remove the OpenAI API key from Settings, then stop the session.
  Expected: the app fails gracefully, explains that the key is missing, and remains usable for the next session.
- Deny microphone permission and attempt to start a session.
  Expected: recording does not start and the error explains how to re-enable access in System Settings.
- Capture a screenshot without Screen Recording permission.
  Expected: recording continues and BugNarrator shows a screenshot-specific error.
- Delete or move a saved screenshot file outside the app, then open it from the session detail view.
  Expected: BugNarrator explains that the local screenshot file is no longer available instead of failing silently.
- Disconnect networking or force a timeout during transcription.
  Expected: transcription ends in a clear timeout or API error state and the app returns to a usable state.
- Use an invalid OpenAI API key.
  Expected: transcription or issue extraction ends in a clear invalid-key error and Settings opens.
- Cancel an active recording.
  Expected: discard confirmation appears first, then the session returns to `Idle` with no stale timer.

## Persistence And Cleanup

- Create several sessions, quit the app, relaunch, and verify the session library reloads correctly.
- If you can simulate a corrupted session-history file, verify the app still recovers from the backup copy instead of showing an empty library.
- Delete a session with screenshots and verify the managed screenshot folder is removed.
- Confirm deleting one session does not remove unrelated files or folders outside BugNarrator's managed session-assets directory.

## Settings Regression

- Change auto-copy, auto-save, and auto-extract toggles and verify the next session follows the new values.
- Change each hotkey and verify the new shortcut is registered.
- While recording, verify secret fields are disabled.
- Enable Debug Mode and confirm temporary audio files are retained after a completed or cancelled session.
- Disable Debug Mode and confirm temporary audio files are cleaned up after a completed or cancelled session.
